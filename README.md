### Problem Statement –
We already have multiple virtual assistants available in market but we hardly use 
them. There are number of people who have issues in voice recognition. These 
systems can understand English phrases but they fail to recognize in our accent. Our 
way of pronunciation is way distinct from theirs. Also, they are easy to use on mobile 
devices than desktop systems. There is need of a virtual assistant that can understand 
English in Indian accent and work on desktop system (Windows). User needs to 
manually manage multiple sets of applications to complete one task and at this time 
a system which can be operated free hand i.e using voice command would make 
user’s work more easy and definitely enhances user experience.
